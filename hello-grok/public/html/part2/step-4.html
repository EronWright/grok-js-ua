        <p>Before we can extract predictions from a model, it must be <em>promoted</em> into a production state. This means that it is actively producing predictions as data is streamed into its stream object. This is accomplished by calling <a href="#" class="trigger"><code>promote()</code></a> on the model itself.</p>
